##  Gudideline 1: Understand the Importance of Software Design
### Features are not software design
The essential code properties we can say are probably: readability, testability, maintainability, extensiblity, reusability and scalability.
But to achieve these properties does not come from features of the language. The structure of the program is responsible for these properties.
Good software is not primarily about the proper use of any feature; rather, it is about solid architecture and design. Good software design can tolerate some bad implementation decisiions, but bad software design cannot be saved by the heroic use of features alone.
### Software Design: The Art of Managing Dependencies and Abstractions
The software design is so important because the change is on the way always. In a good design, that change can be made easily while it can be painful in a bad design.
- Dependency is the key problem in software development at all scales.
There are unavoidable dependencies and artificial dependencies. The software developer's primary concern is to minimize artificial dependencies.
